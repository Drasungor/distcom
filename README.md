    There are networks like IBM World Community Grid where various institutions upload projects for which 
they need to perform simulations or tests on a large scale, requiring substantial computing power. 
Generally, these projects that distribute their calculations contribute to scientific work, so it is 
crucial that the results are verifiable, or one must trust in the results. Because of this, the types 
of problems to be solved should yield results that are easily validated by the user, setting 
aside potential programs that would have high computational complexity, making verification of multiple 
results unfeasible.

    In the face of this problem, one approach is to use a computational integrity test generated by the 
Cairo virtual machine. This allows for addressing more complex problems with solutions whose verification 
is resource intensive. Instead of verifying the solution itself, it becomes possible to verify that the returned 
result comes from a correct execution of the virtual machine on the provided code.
